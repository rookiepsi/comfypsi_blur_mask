<!--
Thank you for suggesting an improvement! Your ideas help make this node better for everyone.

### What problem would this feature solve?

<!--
A clear and concise description of why this change is needed.
Example: "When I use the node for [a specific task], I find I always have to [do a manual step afterwards]. It would be more efficient if the node could do this automatically."

### Describe your proposed enhancement

<!--
Please be as specific as possible. How would you like the node to change?
Check all that apply and provide details below.

- [ ] Add a new widget to the node (like a slider, a dropdown menu, or a text box)
- [ ] Add an input connection (a dot on the left side to connect a noodle from another node)
- [ ] Add an output connection (a dot on the right side to send data to another node)
- [ ] Change how the node works without adding new widgets or connections
- [ ] Other (please describe below)

**Details of your proposal:**

<!--
Provide more details here. For example:
- **For a new widget:** "Add a slider named `intensity` from 0.0 to 2.0."
